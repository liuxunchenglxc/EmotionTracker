## About Source Code

It is an `Android Studio Project`, including `C++` and `Java` code. If you want to build `C++` code, you need add `OpenCV` lib to project like this:

|--app

|--...

|--native
   
|--|--3rdparty
   
|--|--jni
   
|--|--libs
   
|--|--staticlibs

We choose OpenCV 4.1.1 to build it.

This project contain a trial key of Face++. The trial key is a free version of Face++, so we do NOT guarantee the effectiveness of public AI-as-a-Service (Face++).
